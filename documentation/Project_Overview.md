# Project Overview – AI Governance Dashboard

## Purpose

This dashboard simulates governance oversight of AI use-cases within a regulated financial environment.

The goal is to demonstrate how AI initiatives can be monitored across:

- Lifecycle stage progression
- Governance review completion
- Risk categorization
- SLA compliance

---

## AI Lifecycle Stages

1. Intake – Initial submission of AI use-case
2. Under Review – Privacy, Legal, and Risk review in progress
3. Approved – Governance clearance granted
4. Rejected – Governance clearance denied
5. Monitoring – Post-approval oversight

---

## Risk Categorization

Risk levels are categorized as:

- Low – Limited operational or regulatory impact
- Medium – Moderate impact, requires additional oversight
- High – Significant financial, reputational, or compliance exposure

---

## SLA Monitoring

An SLA of 14 days is assumed between intake and decision.

Use-cases exceeding this threshold are flagged as:

"Breached SLA"

## Intended Audience

- AI Review Committee
- Risk & Compliance Teams
- Executive Leadership
